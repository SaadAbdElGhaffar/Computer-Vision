Segmentation algo:
1-global threshold
2-adaptive threshold :It is used under different lighting 
3-Otsu's threshold
4-k-means
5-GMM and EM | soft cluster (this used when there are alot of pixels have mix more than one color)
6-background subtraction

remove the noise and enhacne the image:
1-blurring

Edge Detection:
1-laplacian
2-sobel x
3-sobel y
4-canny detection
5-harris corner detection

Feature Extraction to get important point(pixels):
1-harris corner detection
2-Fast corner detection
3-SIFT 
4-ORB(Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)
5-HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
6-LBP(Local Binary Pattern)

Matching:
1-KD-TREES - large dataset
2-BFMatcher(Brute Force Matcher) - small dataset
3-FLANNMatcher(Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) - large dataset
